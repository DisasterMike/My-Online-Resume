      <i>December 2021 - Current</i>: Unity Programmer for Waseda University
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have been helping Waseda University part-time with their project of
      simulating evacuations during a Tsunami at Kamakura beach using the Unity
      Engine. My role has been to write scripts and set up Navmesh agents to
      simulate how people on foot or in vehicles would react during a tsunami. I
      have worked to set up systems to store data about which evacuation sites
      the agents go to, if and when they make it etc.

      I worked primarily with elementary or kindergarten students. My job
      involved teaching English while in a school setting, so not only focusing
      on English learning, but we also teaching them life skills that they will
      need going forward.

      American Language School
    </h3>
    <p>
      I previously worked as a head teacher in an Eikaiwa school in Chiba. I was
      originally employed to the company as a regular teacher, but after only
      completing my initial contract, I was promoted to being a head teacher. My
      duties as a head teacher included working with and training teachers, as
      well as being responsible for conducting interviews and meetings. I had to
      use primarily Japanese in the office while communicating with my
      colleagues.
