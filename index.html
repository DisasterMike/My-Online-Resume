    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      In my spare time I like to study Japanese or create my own video games and
      board games. I have been interested in video games especially my whole
      life, and now I love to make my own from scratch. I have been working with
      Unity for about 4-5 years and created various projects/prototypes. I've
      also experimented a little with web development languages like HTML, CCS,
      JavaScript and even Ruby. I took an online Mathematics course online
      focused on areas of Computer Science. From October during my free time, I
      plan to study a Computer Science degree online from the University of
      London.
